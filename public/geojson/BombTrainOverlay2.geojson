"text1": "Around 2011, at a period of historically high prices, hydrofracking suddenly began delivering more oil than anyone was prepared to take away. To meet the new demand, North American railroads were transformed into rolling pipelines. As the speculators swooped in to finance even more wells, the Bakken region went through a decade of uncontrolled development. It's the origin point of the sinister hundred-car trains that snake continuously across the Midwest, before snarling up in Chicago.<br>",
"text2": "Pictured on the map are the transloading points where trucks and gathering pipelines deliver the freshly extracted oil to the tank cars. The bursts of fire show some videos of exploding cars along a line that seems to point at Chicago (check out Cassleton along the way). The flaming stack tells some more precise information about the climate consequences of leaking methane.<br>",
"text3": "One simple question: What's the Bakken secret? How does this industry routinely produce disasters? <em>They're too cheap to take the gas out of the freshly fracked oil</em>. In Texas they degasify the oil, so the tankers don't explode. The solution is obvious. But is the failing hydrofracking industry ever going to quit cutting costs to the bone, while risking lives in railroad towns and countless urbanized areas? They will if we all demand it, loudly and without cease. That's the whole point. The entire industry depicted in this map has to change in basic ways." },
