<p>My dear friend and colleague, Dr. Rebecca Dobkins is writing a book called <em>The Art of Ceremony</em> featuring the nine Tribes of Oregon and how Fine Art is integrated into our ceremonial practices. For this project, I created photographs documenting the weaving revival of my community (<span style="font-variant: small-caps;">coos, lower umpqua, siuslaw tribes</span>) and the Na Dosh Ceremony of the Siletz Tribe. Na Dosh is a three day winter dance ceremony that the Siletz have been working to activate for thirty years. Because you may not take photos in ceremony, the Siletz asked that I document the women and regalia as they prepare to dance, an all day and all night process. I helped them unload their regalia from the vehicles to the dressing room and was speechless at the mountain of wealth they have dedicated their lives to collecting and creating. It was a once in a life time privilege to be trusted to document this process and it altered me indelibly. I left the Siletz more committed than ever to my people and our efforts in this work.<p>

<p>Like most of the Tribes in my area, not only were our cultural lifeways disrupted, all items of cultural patrimony were destroyed or stolen by the United States government and settlers in the 1850’s-1930. We own next to nothing of our historic items. The offense of this injustice is more than material. These objects are the living embodiment of our ancestors, they are living beings. They are also our libraries and colleges; they contain all of the knowledge and records of our history. By not having domestic access to them our development is severely arrested.<p>

<p>Over the last few years I have been weaving to create the baseline of our contemporary baskets based on the traditional styles of our people using the photographs of those baskets I create in museum investigation and records of our language. Leaving Na Dosh my focus has shifted to regalia and dance caps specifically. We have no dance caps, in fact in all the museum collections I have investigated; I have only seen a few. As a weaver, this particular area of grief is something with a tangible solution; I am starting with the children.<p>

<p>In our workshops we usually have an even split of children, adults, and elders. As a community we are working so that our youth grow up immersed in their culture, fully integrated into their everyday life. I want them to be comfortable and confident in their privilege as Indigenous people of this land mass. By the time they are representing to their community, both Tribal and mainstream, they will have a fluency and support system to be safe in that role. Part of creating that ease is in participation and education. As in the tradition of our people, the children are there with us when we gather, they are there when we process, they are there when we weave; and they have responsibilities in this work. Sometimes they are asked to lead the prayer, gain permission from the plants for the whole group to gather; sometimes they must offer up the song to soothe and honor the plants while we work. Sometimes, they are tasked to tell the stories embedded in the baskets to the group.<p>

<p>The Hanis and <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">miluk coos</span> people are united with the Lower Umpqua and Siuslaw people. We banded together in the eighties to have enough people to gain federal recognition. Today we have about a thousand people in our combined Tribe; we are spread all over the land mass. Twice a year we gather as a collective, for Winter Celebration in December and Salmon Ceremony in August. Of those thousand people we probably have forty known weavers (twenty-five coming up in my program). Before contact all Tribal people would have been a part of weaving culture, as all people would know their food and speak their language. We want to restore those things but that requires the participation and commitment of the people. It takes substantial commitment and work to acquire these practices and knowledge and for that investment to take root, we must inspire.<p>

<p>The children who are members of the weaving program now will help to achieve that. I have woven each of them dance caps from materials gifted to me by Indigenous weavers around the world, materials that I have gathered, and plants they themselves have gathered. These caps are their ceremonial responsibility. They will be gifted the right to dance these caps into ceremony and be publicly recognized as weavers. This lifts them up in the community as leaders and treasured Tribal members. The caps will work to inspire those in the community who have not yet answered their ancestors call to pick up their privileges and unify their life to land and their spiritual and cultural inheritance.<p>

<img src="images/BlueJay.png" class="fullwidth">

<p>In order for an item to be fully living it has to be danced into ceremony. Five of the caps in this exhibition were danced into Salmon Ceremony this summer; the rest will be danced in the summer of 2019. Art exhibition is also a form of ceremony. For a human being to interact with objects that have been lifted up and set out in this formal manner is a spiritual interface between that object and the viewer. In this way, the baskets that were made after Salmon Ceremony are being activated by you, the viewer.<p>

<p>For the youth, dancing these caps into ceremony is a part of their training. It gives them confidence in their culture, their identity. It helps them to gain and feel the community support and recognition they will need to lead the Tribes publicly and at home as they become adults. When they outgrow the caps, they will weave their own and identify the next youth who will care for the cap they danced as children. They will be instrumental in educating that next generation in our culture and tradition and the continuum will be completely mended by this. Our children overcome genocide with every breath they breathe and every stalk of sedge they pick, with every dance they dance and every word they speak in any language. It feels like everyday life, and it is.</p>
