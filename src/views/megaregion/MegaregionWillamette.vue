    <p>So much depends on a river.</p>

<p>It's nature in the city, a breath of fresh air, a swim in the summertime, a child's delight. It's a fish for a hungry family, a campsite for the houseless, a job for a sailor or a dock worker, a career for a state official. It's a hunting and gathering environment for native American tribes whose ceremonies go back to time immemorial. It's an aquatic world for thousands of species who live in it, on it, above it and along its banks. It's a joy for the eye and the spirit. Plus it's the site of massive industries, still operating or in ruins, and of future public parks for everyone, or maybe gated million-dollar apartment blocks on a gentrified river. Anyway, right now it's a current of clear cool water suffused with toxic substances that sink deep into layers of sediment and concentrate in the bodies of living organisms.</p>

<p>The Portland Harbor reach of the Willamette River has been polluted since the late nineteenth century. Up to the 1970s the main concern was raw sewage flushing directly into the stream. Major progress was made across the state under governor Tom McCall, in office from 1967 to 1975; but in Portland the sewage problem dragged on until the recent completion of the Big Pipe, which captures most of the effluent that used to spill out from combined sewer and storm drain overflows. What remains at issue is something quite different: a host of invisible chemicals lodged in the silt and sand of the riverbed, or leaching into the water from legacy debris and active industrial installations.</p>

<p>After decades of advocacy, in the year 2000 the Portland Harbor was placed on the Environmental Protection Agency's National Priorities List, transforming it into what everyone still calls a Superfund site. As the 2000's rolled on, the feds organized "early interventions" to address some of the ongoing disasters at surface level. When that was over, the waiting game began. The two big questions were, what needs to be done in the river itself, and who's gonna pay for it?</p>

<p>It's hard for people to understand that EPA no longer has funds for anything but emergency work on its Superfund sites, and that a deal would therefore have to be struck with the devil himself, in order to get some of the over 150 Potentially Reponsible Parties (PRPs) to step up and agree to pay for the preliminary operations. Ten of the major corporate entities did so, later joined by four others, forming the Lower Willamette Group. In an extremely dubious scenario of "yes you can be judge and party on the same case," this group paid for and organized the initial scientific analysis that would later help determine its cleanup responsibilities. But the superfunding problem is hardly over. Extensive litigation, often between the PRPs themselves, will be required to get the others to cough up their share.</p>

<p>Despite the cynicism and apathy that this kind of deal-making, science-rigging and lawyer-sicking constantly threatens to engender, the public weighed in massively during the final deliberations over the future of the Superfund site. Over 5,300 comments on the horrendously complex cleanup alternatives gave proof that "citizen oversight" is not a mere phrase. EPA then issued its long-awaited Record of Decision in January of 2017. The unprecedented level of involvement had tipped the scales toward a more rigorous plan, known in poetic English as as "Alternative F Modified."</p>

<p>The 3,012-page EPA Record of Decision stipulates exactly what the sources of pollution are (though that's not yet fully known), exactly which areas will be treated (but watch out for shrinking expectations), exactly which technologies will be employed (or at least the most basic categories), and how long all this will take (roughly sixteen to eighteen years). Plus there's an estimate of how much it's all going to cost (over $1 billion). One would like to derive more certainty from this document, but it appears mainly to be an ordered and rationalized archive of all the previous studies. Beyond the relatively precise indication and justification of zones of future intervention, the most decisive statements in it are those that define margins of uncertainty awaiting future research.</p>

<p>What opens up next is called, in sublime bureaucratese, the "pre-remedial design phase," which means two more years of sitewide baseline sampling before any detailed cleanup plan can be determined. The baseline sampling will provide a yardstick for future monitoring to ensure that recovery objectives have actually been met. In the background of this technical and scientific activity, the lawyers of the Potentially Responsible Parties are slugging it out behind closed doors, each trying to force the other to repent in cash for past misdeeds.</p>

<p>Zoom in closer on the map to see what all the hue and cry is about.</p>

<p>First to appear are the so-called "upland sites," colored dark red, where the pollution still washes right off the shore or leaches into the groundwater. The most dangerous substances are polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), an extremely long-lived toxin manufactured by Monsanto and used as flame-retardant lubricants and hydraulic fluids in a wide range of industrial processes. (The City of Portland, the Port of Portland and the State of Oregon are suing Monsanto in the attempt to recover some of their PCB cleanup costs.) Also at stake are the pesticide DDT and its breakdown products, manufactured at the Arkema plant on the western bank at River Mile 7. Plus there are the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, or PAHs, released from burning coal, oil, gasoline and various kinds of trash, as well as highly carcinogenic dioxins and furans which come out of many different industrial processes, such as creosote production and paper pulping. Of course there are many other chemical pollutants and heavy metals out there, but the list above is the worst of the worst: the super-death-stars of the superfund site.</p>

<p>Source control of toxic substances at the upland sites is handled by Oregon's Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ). Each site has been ranked as high, medium or low priority, plus a final good-to-go category ("source control complete or not needed"). If you click on the polygons, a window appears with a link that takes you directly to DEQ's record of the site's condition, detailing the interventions that have been carried out or are still required.</p>

<p>To go a little further, it might be worth reading the report on the former GASCO oil-gasification site on the western bank between River Miles 6 and 7, now owned by a successor company that goes by the ironic name of Northwest Natural. Here an "early intervention" by the company itself in 2005 removed a giant 15,000 cubic-yard tarball from the river, in hopes of stanching the flow of benzene, cyanide, naphtalene and PAHs into the environment. However this was not enough because large portions of the site, and of the neighboring Siltronic parcel, are still filled with tar leaching into the groundwater. Northwest Natural loyally spent some $21 million on a groundwater treatment system to take care of the problem. </p>

<p>The last DEQ report, dated 2012, puts it like this: "Removal action consists of a well-based hydraulic control and containment system that is also being implemented as a groundwater source-control measure along ~2,200 feet of NW Natural's and Siltronic Corporation shorelines." Sounds good&mdash;but a group of downriver corporations including BP, Exxon-Mobil and Toyota is now claiming that tar is still flowing out of the ground and into the river, and that NW Natural should be responsible for downriver interventions to clean it up. Is it true, or is it a complex strategy within the blame-game of the current "allocation" phase of superfund responsibilities? Northwest Natural, for its part, is preparing to spend as much as five times more than its initial $21 million outlay, in order to clean up the remaining pollutants that it claims are safely sequestered on its own property.</p>

<p>Next comes the more difficult question: how to deal with the "potential threat waste" (ie, toxic chemicals and heavy metals) that has already made its way into the river?</p>

<p>The major issue here is that removal by dredging is the best option, except that dredging risks releasing currently trapped toxins for dispersal further down the river, making the existing problem worse. Every decision about what to do with particular toxins under particular riverbed conditions must square this circle. Fortunately after sixteen years of study, EPA has come up with a short list of possible interventions, whose implementation strategies have been partially tested by recent work on the Hudson River. So far these interventions are deceptively simple: dredge it, cap it with sand so it doesn't move, dredge it and cap it, or leave it under the delicate attentions of "enhanced natural recovery" (whatever that means). The matter is complicated by the fact that many of the areas where pollutant levels require intervention are location in the navigation channel of the river, which was formerly maintained at a depth of forty feet, and which the Army Corps of Engineers is anxious to lower to 43 feet. Here the removal zones, with their associated caps or backfills, must be calculated to withstand future Army Corps dredging without the release of additional poisons into the water.</p>

<p>At the time of writing (November 2018), the patient civil-society overseers of this process are furious. According to EPA, new research has shown that a compound called benzo(a)pyrene, one of the PAHs that is particularly prevalent in the Gasco and Terminal 4 areas of the Superfund site, is seven times less toxic than previously thought. This change in assumed toxicity would reduce the total area of intervention by about 17 acres and lower the cost by about $35 million. To be sure, this is a small adjustment for a $1 billion cleanup covering 2,200 acres. However, benzo(a)pyrene is the first organic compound that was ever found to be associated with cancer: its toxic effect was noted as far back as the eighteenth century, and it has been considered highly carcinogenic throughout the twentieth century and up to today. Under the pesent governmental climate, where science is either ignored or routinely adjusted for political expediency, this sudden change in the freshly minted Record of Decision appears like an ominous harbinger of a dangerous future.</p>

<p>Who are these civil society groups? Prominent among them are Willamette Riverkeeper, the Audobon Society and the Portland Harbor Coalition (whose precise and moving video is shown above). Perhaps most directly involved in the technical details of the cleanup is the Portland Harbor Community Advisory Group, known as the CAG. The members of these organizations are the living stars of the Portland Harbor Superfund process. In many ways, the future of the Lower Willamette River depends on them. For the most informed, complete, down-to-earth summary of the Superfund situation as it stood in mid-2017, listen to the video interview with the CAG's Barbara Quinn, below.</p>
