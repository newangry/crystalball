        <p>What you see on the map are plumes of contaminated groundwater spreading out from leaking tanks buried on the Central Plateau, or infiltrating from the many ditches, pools and pipelines where toxic chemicals were simply dumped without any pretense of containment.</p>

        <p>The plumes, which are artifically separated into distinct bodies by the graphic representation, have been identified and tracked by means of samples withdrawn by technicians from hundreds of test wells drilled into the Hanford Reservation, which is roughly twenty-five miles across from east to west.</p>

        <p>In addition, the reactor sites along the Columbia River are surrounded by sinks of hexavalent chromium, added as an anti-corrosion agent to the cooling water. Hexavalent chromium, which is highly toxic to salmon in particular, entered the river in large quantities during the period of Hanford's active operation.</p>

        <p>Over the last decade, billions of gallons of groundwater have been pumped out and filtered in a Herculean attempt to prevent further contamination. Yet the plumes persist, and hexavalent chromium still reaches the Columbia.</p>

        <p>On the Central Plateau, a massive Vitrification Plant is being constructed in an attempt to seal the tank waste inside glass logs for permanent burial. However, the $17-billion-and-counting "Vit plant," underway since 2002, has been plagued by technical difficulties, delays and cost overruns. High-level waste is not expected to be processed into glass until 2036&mdash;if ever, according to more skeptical evaluations.</p>

        <p>Try to imagine the life of a single-shell carbon steel tank, up to one million gallons in capacity, welded together on site some fifty to seventy years ago, then encased in concrete, buried beneath the desert and gradually filled with chemical waste at high levels of radioactivity.</p>

        <p>Caustic solutions including sodium nitrate, sodium hydroxide, sodium aluminate and sodium phosphate are pumped to the tanks from neighboring facilities built to extract uranium and plutonium from the spent fuel slugs. Further solutions from equipment wash-downs are added to the mix. Suspended in the chemical bath are radionuclides including uranium, plutonium, strontium-90, cesium-137, americium-241 and technetium-99.</p>

        <p>Over time, water infiltrates into many of the 149 single-shell tanks, while others are subject to sustained high heat generated by the chemicals. The steel bubbles, pits and corrodes, while the concrete exterior slowly decays. The earliest tanks were designed for a useful life of only twenty years. Sixty-seven of the single-shell tanks eventually leak.</p>

        <p>When environmental cleanup finally begins, the liquid component of the waste is transferred to twenty-eight previously constructed double-shell tanks, built anywhere from thirty to fifty years ago. Transfers are effected through existing vertical pipes, some only one foot across. Extraordinarily dangerous vapors are released during the transfer process, which is all done by workers wrestling with pumps, pipes, remote-controlled devices and a plethora of plastic shrouds. Two of the supposedly safer double-shell tanks have leaked. As DOE acknowledges, chemical percipitates and radioactive waste remain behind in the older single-shells:</p>

        <div class="quote"><p>"Whatâ€™s left inside the tanks today are saltcakes, a material with the consistency of wet beach sand, and sludges. Also inside are wastes which resemble peanut butter, small broken icebergs, foam, or whitish crystals. None of these wastes are easily removed."</p></div>

        <p>Now try to imagine the lives of the workers who are nonetheless charged with monitoring the tanks, manipulating the pipes and valves, transferring liquids and in some cases, removing solids from the bottom of damaged units.</p>

        <p>The first thing to realize is that the "headspace" of each tank is filled with toxic vapor from as many as 1,500 chemicals, which must be vented to avoid explosions. Workers assigned to tank operations, often without masks or supplied air, suddenly catch one acrid breath of vapor. Just that one breath can cause chemical burns in the lungs, followed by lifetime health consequences that may also include neurological damage. Over seventy workers received medical examinations for vapor incidents in the period from March 2014 to September 2015. Hundreds of workers have been injured by vapor inhalation over the thirty years since cleanup began.</p>

        <p>Other categories of workers have been exposed to airborne flakes of plutonium, which can lodge inside the body and cause lung, kidney and bone cancers. Thirty-one tested positive for plutonium inhalation after an incident that occurred during the demolition of the Plutonium Finishing Plant on June 8, 2017. In addition to entering their lungs, the microscopic flakes also accumulated on their clothes and even made it into their cars, carrying the contamination back to their homes and families.</p>

        <p>The Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act was passed in October 2000, allowing DOE nuclear workers to file claims for radiogenic cancers, berryllium poisoning and silicosis. Some 53,000 workers have been awarded payouts capped at $400,000, for a total of approximately $12 billion. On March 7, 2018, Washington state legislation was passed to relieve Hanford workers of the burden of proving which of the 1,500 vapor chemicals may have caused their illness (through suits may still be disqualified by proof of non-workplace causation). In September 2018, a lawsuit in the state of Washington led to a settlement mandating much more stringent safety measures for the vapor workers. As for the Hanford "downwinders" exposed to iodine-129 and other radioactive particles during the war, the immense majority of their cases were finally rejected in 2015 after two decades of litigation. DOE reportedly paid out a total of $60 million in legal defense fees and on.ly $7 million in compensation.</p>

        <p>Hanford is about the slow movement of toxic compounds through bodies, from the groundwater on up. Do the people in power even care? In 2018 the Department of Energy announced plans to to reclassify some of the solidified tank sludge as low-level waste, meaning that it could simply be covered in a specialized concrete, known as "grout" in cleanup jargon. The tank farms would then become de facto nuclear graveyards&mdash;abandoned for eternity, not thousands of feet underground in a natural chasm or a salt mine, but near major population centers, just a few feet below the surface.</p>
